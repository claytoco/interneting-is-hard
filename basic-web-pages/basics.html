    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outine of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make a unordered list</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" elelment (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" (list item) elelment</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order (is IS an UN-ordered list)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is whar an ordered list looks like</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything </li>
      <li>But, the list item (li) elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things in this percise order, because it is an ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline elements</h2>

    <p><em>Sometines</em>, you need to draw attention to a particlar word or phase</p>

    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phase</p>

    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
